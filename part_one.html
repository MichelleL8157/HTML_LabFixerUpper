<!--
  I reorganized the format of the code so that the indents of the child elements go under its parent.
  For example, for lines 11-21, the code in between was part of the content class, so that code had to be indentented in.
  I can't see the changes I made to the original code since I uploaded the file once to github so it only has the progress I made
  until the reflections, but most of the problem was with the indentations.
